# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-22)

**Core value:** An Order exists and ships to Gelato only after reliable, validated, idempotent Stripe-webhook payment confirmation — no phantom charge, no duplicate order, no improper fulfillment.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — catalog-media (all 5 plans executed; `CAT-03`, `CAT-04` and `MEDIA-01` documented complete; final phase gate still pending)

## Execution Policy

Execution is manual-review gated.

No phase may be executed automatically. Each phase must stop after CONTEXT, RESEARCH, PLAN, SPEC/SDD, IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT, EXECUTION, VERIFICATION, REVIEW, and CLOSURE for human review before continuing.

The GSD auto chain must not continue through all phases.

**Enforcement settings (config.json):**

- `mode` was changed from `yolo` to `interactive` so GSD shows gates and confirmations instead of running autonomously. (`manual`/`controlled` are not valid GSD enum values; `interactive` is the schema-valid manual-gated mode.)
- `workflow.auto_advance` remains `false`.
- `workflow._auto_chain_active` remains `false`.
- `parallelization` remains `false`.

Phase 01 was executed under supervision on branch `gsd/phase-01-foundation-observability` and is now closed. CONTEXT, RESEARCH, PLAN, SPEC/SDD, execution, verification, smoke, and closure were completed under manual-review gating.

**Current gate:** All five Phase 02 plans are documented complete. Do not close Phase 02 yet. The next permitted step is only the final human gate/closeout for the phase.

**Branch policy:**

`git.branching_strategy` is `phase` (GSD-supported). Active branch: `gsd/phase-01-foundation-observability` (`phase_branch_template`: `gsd/phase-{phase}-{slug}`).

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (catalog-media) — all 5 plans executed; final phase gate pending
Plan: 5 plans defined; 5 complete (02-01, 02-02, 02-03, 02-04, 02-05); Phase 01 closed (7/7)
Status: Phase 02 plan slices are fully documented complete; phase closeout intentionally pending the final gate
Last activity: 2026-06-27 - 02-04/CAT-03 and 02-05/CAT-04 registered as closed documentally after approved summaries

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Order created only by the canonical Stripe webhook; webhook ingest (P5) lands before Order creation (P6).
- [Roadmap]: purchase_completed is a durable backend outbox event (P7); Gelato fulfillment (P9) gates on the local `recorded` record, never on PostHog success.
- [Roadmap]: Refund updates financial state only post-webhook and never auto-cancels the order (P11).
- [Governance]: For implementation, PRD Backend v1.1 + DB_MODEL v1.21 override older SRS wording that suggests Order/awaiting_payment before confirmed payment. Pre-payment state lives in Cart, PaymentCollection, PaymentSession, and PaymentAttempt. Order exists only after canonical Stripe webhook payment confirmation. (Also recorded in PROJECT.md Key Decisions for planning-agent visibility.)
- [Governance]: Phase 2 (Catalog & Media) delivers only the Gelato snapshot builder/helper/contract + unit tests; actual `LineItem.metadata.gelato_snapshot` persistence is verified in Phase 6 where Order creation exists.
- [Phase 02 planning]: Phase 02 was decomposed into 5 plans across 3 waves: central Gelato metadata contract, sellable/publish gate, Supabase Storage provider wiring, public Store API contract, and pure Gelato snapshot builder with future Phase 6 contract.
- [Phase 02 execution]: All five planned slices now have approved SUMMARY artifacts. This documentary closeout updates STATE/ROADMAP/REQUIREMENTS only; final Phase 02 gate and closure remain intentionally pending.
- [Plan 01-03]: Locking module uses `REDIS_URL` via `@medusajs/medusa/locking-redis`; no fifth Redis contract in Phase 01.
- [Plan 01-04]: Logging uses allowlist-first sanitization with exact-pinned `pino@10.3.1` and dev-only `pino-pretty@13.1.3`; audit findings remain documented and non-blocking because fixes require broad dependency changes outside Plan 01-04.
- [Plan 01-05]: Sentry uses exact-pinned `@sentry/node@10.59.0`, `sendDefaultPii=false`, allowlist scrubbing hooks, and a single Medusa-delegating error capture path keyed by sanitized grouping metadata.
- [Plan 01-06]: Health readiness checks only Postgres and Redis in parallel; expected dependency failures are sanitized warnings and do not create Sentry events by default.
- [Plan 01-07 / Deployment checkpoint]: The original VPS/PM2/Nginx route was superseded in this cycle by Heroku as the current production target. The validated app is `espacoliminar`, release `v27`, deployed commit `d02fd70`, with `APP_VERSION=d02fd70`.
- [Plan 01-07 / Deployment checkpoint]: Current production operations use Heroku web/worker dynos, Supabase Postgres through the pooler, Heroku Redis with TLS, and Heroku release phase for `db:migrate:safe`.
- [Plan 01-07 / Deployment checkpoint]: `REDIS_CACHE_PROVIDER_DISABLED=true` is active on Heroku; the `@medusajs/caching-redis` provider remains temporarily disabled by flag to avoid the Heroku TLS/self-signed loop. Redis remains active for health checks and the remaining Redis-backed modules.
- [Plan 01-07 / Deployment checkpoint]: `/health/live` and `/health/ready` were validated in production with HTTP 200; readiness reports Postgres `up` and Redis `up`; `web.1` and `worker.1` are up.
- [Plan 01-07 / Deployment checkpoint]: Local branch `gsd/phase-01-foundation-observability`, `origin/gsd-...`, and `heroku/main` are synchronized on `d02fd70`.
- [Production smoke]: Smoke test on Heroku app `espacoliminar` passed on 2026-06-26. Current release is `v27`, `APP_VERSION=d02fd70`, `REDIS_CACHE_PROVIDER_DISABLED=true`, `web.1` and `worker.1` are up, `/health/live` and `/health/ready` return 200, readiness reports Postgres `up` and Redis `up`, web/worker logs show no Redis/TLS loop patterns, and public read-only routes returned no 5xx.
- [Phase 01 closure]: Closure completed on 2026-06-26. The original VPS/PM2/Nginx route remains as a portable blueprint, while the validated operational checkpoint for this cycle is Heroku app `espacoliminar` with Supabase Postgres via pooler, Heroku Redis with TLS, Heroku release phase for `db:migrate:safe`, and Phase 02 left unstarted behind a human review gate.
- [Plan 02-03]: `@medusajs/file-s3@2.16.0` wired via `@medusajs/medusa/file` + `@medusajs/medusa/file-s3` with `forcePathStyle: true`; production env fail-fast for six S3 vars; manual Admin upload smoke confirmed public Supabase URL and product media association — MEDIA-01 closed.
- [Plan 02-04]: The standard Medusa Store API now exposes only the stable shopper-facing catalog surface, with BRL pricing, public media URLs, and no public `gelato_*` fields; non-sellable variants stay hidden from the public contract.
- [Plan 02-05]: `buildGelatoSnapshot` closed as a pure typed immutable contract, reusing the same sellable validation source as 02-01/02-02; CAT-04 is complete for Phase 02 via builder + contract + unit tests, while actual `LineItem.metadata.gelato_snapshot` persistence remains deferred to Phase 6 consumption.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Roadmap]: REQUIREMENTS.md summary previously stated "44 total"; the v1 list actually contains 45 distinct REQ-IDs. Count corrected to 45 during roadmap creation.
- [Phase 4/5]: MEDIUM confidence on whether Medusa's bundled Stripe provider fully supports Pix's async lifecycle vs needing a custom provider — flag for planning spike.
- [Phase 9]: Gelato has no official Medusa provider/SDK; draft→confirm pattern and webhook signature scheme need API-level verification during planning.
- [Deployment checkpoint]: The release dyno may still emit `ECONNRESET`/`ioredis` during `db:migrate:safe`. This did not block release `v27` and did not appear in filtered web/worker runtime logs. Later investigation: whether `db:migrate:safe` can run without initializing unnecessary Redis providers during migrations.

## Quick Tasks Completed

| Date | Task | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| 2026-06-25 | 260625-i9n-remover-canary-de-stripe-com-formato-rea | Removed a Stripe-shaped test canary from observability tests and rewrote the local 01-04 commit with autosquash so GitHub Push Protection can accept the branch push. |
| 2026-06-26 | 260626-hsr-heroku-supabase-redis-checkpoint | Documented the Heroku/Supabase/Redis deployment stabilization checkpoint and recorded the next cycle as production backend smoke test. |
| 2026-06-26 | 2026-06-26-production-backend-smoke | Validated production backend smoke on Heroku/Supabase/Redis with health, version, dynos, logs, public read-only routes, and no business-data mutation; Phase 01 is ready for closure while Phase 02 remains blocked. |
| 2026-06-26 | phase-01-closure | Closed Phase 01 with sanitized evidence, preserved the release-dyno Redis migration debt as deferred investigation, and left Phase 02 available only as the next manual-review-gated cycle. |
| 2026-06-26 | phase-02-planning | Planned only the Catalog & Media phase from the approved 02-CONTEXT.md, producing 5 execution plans plus validation strategy, while keeping execution blocked behind manual review. |

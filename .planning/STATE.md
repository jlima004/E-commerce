# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-22)

**Core value:** An Order exists and ships to Gelato only after reliable, validated, idempotent Stripe-webhook payment confirmation — no phantom charge, no duplicate order, no improper fulfillment.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-observability

## Execution Policy

Execution is manual-review gated.

No phase may be executed automatically. Each phase must stop after CONTEXT, RESEARCH, PLAN, SPEC/SDD, IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT, EXECUTION, VERIFICATION, REVIEW, and CLOSURE for human review before continuing.

The GSD auto chain must not continue through all phases.

**Enforcement settings (config.json):**

- `mode` was changed from `yolo` to `interactive` so GSD shows gates and confirmations instead of running autonomously. (`manual`/`controlled` are not valid GSD enum values; `interactive` is the schema-valid manual-gated mode.)
- `workflow.auto_advance` remains `false`.
- `workflow._auto_chain_active` remains `false`.
- `parallelization` remains `false`.

Phase 01 is in supervised execution on branch `gsd/phase-01-foundation-observability`. CONTEXT, RESEARCH, PLAN, and SPEC/SDD for Phase 01 were generated and reviewed; implementation proceeds plan-by-plan under manual-review gating.

**Current gate:** The Heroku/Supabase/Redis production deployment checkpoint is documented and stabilized. The next allowed cycle is **Smoke Test backend em produção** only — never auto-advancing to Phase 02.

**Branch policy:**

`git.branching_strategy` is `phase` (GSD-supported). Active branch: `gsd/phase-01-foundation-observability` (`phase_branch_template`: `gsd/phase-{phase}-{slug}`).

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation-observability) — PENDING PRODUCTION SMOKE
Plan: 7 of 7 complete; next allowed cycle: production backend smoke test
Status: Heroku/Supabase/Redis deployment checkpoint documented and stabilized
Last activity: 2026-06-26 - Heroku/Supabase/Redis deployment checkpoint

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Order created only by the canonical Stripe webhook; webhook ingest (P5) lands before Order creation (P6).
- [Roadmap]: purchase_completed is a durable backend outbox event (P7); Gelato fulfillment (P9) gates on the local `recorded` record, never on PostHog success.
- [Roadmap]: Refund updates financial state only post-webhook and never auto-cancels the order (P11).
- [Governance]: For implementation, PRD Backend v1.1 + DB_MODEL v1.21 override older SRS wording that suggests Order/awaiting_payment before confirmed payment. Pre-payment state lives in Cart, PaymentCollection, PaymentSession, and PaymentAttempt. Order exists only after canonical Stripe webhook payment confirmation. (Also recorded in PROJECT.md Key Decisions for planning-agent visibility.)
- [Governance]: Phase 2 (Catalog & Media) delivers only the Gelato snapshot builder/helper/contract + unit tests; actual `LineItem.metadata.gelato_snapshot` persistence is verified in Phase 6 where Order creation exists.
- [Plan 01-03]: Locking module uses `REDIS_URL` via `@medusajs/medusa/locking-redis`; no fifth Redis contract in Phase 01.
- [Plan 01-04]: Logging uses allowlist-first sanitization with exact-pinned `pino@10.3.1` and dev-only `pino-pretty@13.1.3`; audit findings remain documented and non-blocking because fixes require broad dependency changes outside Plan 01-04.
- [Plan 01-05]: Sentry uses exact-pinned `@sentry/node@10.59.0`, `sendDefaultPii=false`, allowlist scrubbing hooks, and a single Medusa-delegating error capture path keyed by sanitized grouping metadata.
- [Plan 01-06]: Health readiness checks only Postgres and Redis in parallel; expected dependency failures are sanitized warnings and do not create Sentry events by default.
- [Plan 01-07 / Deployment checkpoint]: The original VPS/PM2/Nginx route was superseded in this cycle by Heroku as the current production target. The validated app is `espacoliminar`, release `v27`, deployed commit `d02fd70`, with `APP_VERSION=d02fd70`.
- [Plan 01-07 / Deployment checkpoint]: Current production operations use Heroku web/worker dynos, Supabase Postgres through the pooler, Heroku Redis with TLS, and Heroku release phase for `db:migrate:safe`.
- [Plan 01-07 / Deployment checkpoint]: `REDIS_CACHE_PROVIDER_DISABLED=true` is active on Heroku; the `@medusajs/caching-redis` provider remains temporarily disabled by flag to avoid the Heroku TLS/self-signed loop. Redis remains active for health checks and the remaining Redis-backed modules.
- [Plan 01-07 / Deployment checkpoint]: `/health/live` and `/health/ready` were validated in production with HTTP 200; readiness reports Postgres `up` and Redis `up`; `web.1` and `worker.1` are up.
- [Plan 01-07 / Deployment checkpoint]: Local branch `gsd/phase-01-foundation-observability`, `origin/gsd-...`, and `heroku/main` are synchronized on `d02fd70`.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Roadmap]: REQUIREMENTS.md summary previously stated "44 total"; the v1 list actually contains 45 distinct REQ-IDs. Count corrected to 45 during roadmap creation.
- [Phase 4/5]: MEDIUM confidence on whether Medusa's bundled Stripe provider fully supports Pix's async lifecycle vs needing a custom provider — flag for planning spike.
- [Phase 9]: Gelato has no official Medusa provider/SDK; draft→confirm pattern and webhook signature scheme need API-level verification during planning.
- [Deployment checkpoint]: The release dyno may still emit `ECONNRESET`/`ioredis` during `db:migrate:safe`. This did not block release `v27` and did not appear in filtered web/worker runtime logs. Later investigation: whether `db:migrate:safe` can run without initializing unnecessary Redis providers during migrations.
